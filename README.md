#Portfolio

##Goal
Create a portfolio of my work to be accessible by prospective employers. The portfolio should display basic skills in HTML and CSS, while displaying the projects I have completed in the Web Development Bootcamp in 2021. All the links should open to new pages, or download specified files.
